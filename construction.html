                We create and publicly release a new, large-scale Chinese structured recipe dataset (CMRFood), which
                includes more than 70,000 recipes and 2 million images. Compared to previous datasets, CMRFood includes
                more fine-grained information, such as nutrient content (calories, sugars, and fats) and recipe
                attributes (e.g., craft, taste, time, difficulty, and cuisine). In the following subsections, we outline
                how this dataset is collected and organized, and analyze its content.

                These recipe images are collected from a Chinese recipe sharing website Meishijie. We process the data
                through two pipelines, one extracting relevant text from raw HTML, and the other downloading linked
                images. The data is then assembled into a one-row compact JSON data structure, where each data item
                (recipe and image) is uniquely identified. As part of the extraction process data, excessive whitespace,
                HTML entities and non-ASCII characters are removed from the recipe text.

                Due to the lack of complete images for a single recipe, we choose to expand the number of complete
                images. With the rapid growth of social networks and the Internet of Things (IOT), more than half of the
                world's population is using the Internet. Many Internet users choose to share their images, recipes and
                food information on social networking sites or professional food websites. We use the recipe name as an
                index to download images from other recipe sharing sites, such as Meishizhongguo and Geogle search
                engines. With these websites, we download a large number of images according to the recipe names,
                enriching our dataset.

                The content of the CMRFood dataset can be logically divided into two layers. The first layer is the
                basic information of the text data, including titles, ingredient lists, preparation steps, suitable
                people, a series of descriptions of nutritional ingredients, and notes with recipe attributes (such as
                craft, taste, time, difficulty, and cuisine), which are provided as JSON text. The second layer builds
                on the first layer and includes any images associated with the recipe (complete and step images), which
                are provided in RGB in JPEG format.

                As the data comes from Internet users, it is necessary to be filtered. Our screening basis is as
                follows:

            <ul>
                <li>(1) There are at least five cooking steps to ensure sufficient information is included.</li>
                <li>(2) Each step has a text description and an image.</li>
            </ul>

            Filtered according to the condition that there are no less than five steps and each step has image-text
            pairs, the total number of recipes is 71,110, with 2067,554 complete images and 657,757 step images.

            The dataset adopts a two-level classification method. The first level is divided into Chinese cuisine,
            home-cooked recipes, and local snacks.

            <ul>
                <li>(1) Chinese Cuisine
